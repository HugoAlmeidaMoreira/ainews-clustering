v. Learning from Complex Data [3v]

20. Classify the following statements as True or False:

a) The order of a multivariate time series corresponds to the number of time points. False
b) Pattern mining in time series can be either considered in the context of a single time series (e.g. motif discovery) or multiple time series (e.g. biclustering). True
c) When computing the distance between time series, Minkowski distances (e.g. Euclidean) cannot account for temporal misalignments. True
d) Statistics extracted with a sliding window along time series observations can be used to produce a multivariate dataset. True
e) As frequent itemsets are solely focused on co-occurrences, sequential patterns are solely focused on precedences. False
f) Given time series data, biclustering can be extended to accommodate time lags between observations. True
g) Nominal univariate events are also termed typed events. True
h) Complex patterns can generally be mapped into binary or numeric variables (one variable per pattern) for subsequent multivariate data analysis. True
i) The data of a system with stationary sensors producing signals at different locations can be described by a georeferenced time series structure. True
j) The spatial slicing principle suggests that is rather more important to learn global models than multiple local/regional models. False
k) Inductive logic can be used to capture associations between tables. True
