15. [1.4v] Selecting $y_1$ and $y_2$, identify the largest constant bicluster and the largest order-preserving bicluster with $\delta = 0$ and no noise ($\varepsilon = 0$)

Constant (I={x1,x4}, J={y1,y2}), Order-preserving (I={x1,x2,x3,x4}, J={y1,y2})

16. [0.8v] Given the additive bicluster (I={x1,x2,x3,x4}, J={y1,y2}) and $\delta = 0$, compute its quality.

Considering additive factors $\{\gamma_1 = 0, \gamma_2 = 2, \gamma_3 = 2, \gamma_4 = 0\}$, the quality is 7/8

17. [0.75v] Classify the following statements as True or False:

a) A biclustering solution with 2 biclusters with overlapping elements is always non-exhaustive on rows and columns. False
b) Given a biclustering search, a statistically significant bicluster that was not retrieved by this search is termed false positive. False
c) The coherence strength of a bicluster determines the deviations from expectations. True

18. [0.5v] Which of the following actions generally increase the average size of patterns in a solution (where size is the number of elements, i.e. support × pattern length):

a) increase tolerance to noise (i.e. decrease quality)
b) choose closed pattern representations instead of all patterns
c) given perfect quality, increase the cardinality of variables in discrete data
d) decrease coherence strength (higher deviations allowed) in real-valued data

## IV. Outlier analysis [1.25v]

19. Classify the following statements as True or False:

a) Given specific context variables, a contextual outlier observation is an observation that significantly deviates from other observations that share the same context. True
b) A collective outlier is an observation that deviates from neighbour observations. False
c) Observations in clusters with bad cohesion (sparse clusters) are outlier candidates. True
d) Given a data where a few observations are annotated with normal/non-outlier tag, these observations should be removed to better detect outliers. False
e) Density-based outlier analysis approaches can be used to identify local outliers. True
