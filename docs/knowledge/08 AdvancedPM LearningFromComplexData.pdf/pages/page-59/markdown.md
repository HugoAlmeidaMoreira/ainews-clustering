# Mining interval series data

- Clustering using dedicated distances for interval series
- Classification and regression
- traditional learners using statistics from interval series
- distance-based learners with distances on interval series
- associative learners using interval patterns
- Deep representations using dedicated neural architectures
- Prompting engineering
- Note: there are variants not only prepared for time intervals but feature intervals
- e.g. daily variation of temperature (min-max) along a year
- correctly interpret dependencies between pairs of features defining an interval
