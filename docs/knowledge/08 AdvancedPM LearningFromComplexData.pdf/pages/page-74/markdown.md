# Spatial outlier analysis

## Types of outliers
- global outlier versus spatial outlier (contextual/local)
- georeferenced data: outliers are observations with deviant behavior and location (referred as multi-attribute spatial outliers)
- continuous spatial data: outliers are regions with unexpected values/events

## Approaches
- quantitative outlier detection: scatter plot, and z-score
- graph-based outlier detection: variogram, Moran scatter plot

## Challenges
- adequate spatial statistical tests
- collective spatial outlier detection
