# Signals... any care?

- Signals collected from sensors show unique complexities
- Time series representations essential to:
- Reveal the **internal structure** of the signal
- decompose signal into a set of meaningful components

- Alternatives to deep learning? Yes...
- describe *raw signal* as a finite *composition of well-known abstractions*
- spectral analysis
- **Fourier** transform for biosensors (e.g. brain waves from EEG)
- **Wavelet** transform in telemetry (e.g. appliances on from utility consumption sensors)
