# Learning from temporal data: LLM prompting

LLM "analytical" capacities:

- Compositional Reasoning for chain descriptive-predictive subtasks in complex data analysis pipelines
- Flexible Input-Output Mapping with prompting allowing for custom input and output formats
- Prior Knowledge Integration from learnt domain heuristics and background associative patterns
- Robustness to Imperfect Data (tolerance to missing, noisy, inconsistent inputs) from contextual inference
- Task Unification via Language by reformulating data-driven tasks as a "predict the next token" task
- Prompt-Controlled Inductive Bias by imposing temporal-causality assumptions and constraints on reasoning and outputs, effectively steering the model toward task-specific behavior

The promise: the increasing LLMs size and context from multi-modal and multi-stage analyses can push LLMs to answer complex, specialized descriptive and predictive tasks
