- set-oriented: union, intersection, membership, etc.
- topological: meet, within, overlap, etc.
- directional: North, NE, left, behind, etc.
- metric: distance, area, perimeter, etc.
- dynamic: update, create, destroy, etc.
- granularity-based
- shape-based and visibility

|  Granularity | Elevation example | Road example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Local | Elevation | On road?  |
|  Focal | Slope | Adjacent to road?  |
|  Zonal | Highest elevation in a zone | Distance to nearest road  |
