# Learning from event data

- Clustering with dedicated distances between events sets
- Clustering, classification and regression
- traditional learners using neural embeddings or statistics from event sets
- distances between event sets
- discriminative patterns in event data (next slides): associative models
- Distances between event sets:
- map events into sequence data by focusing on orders
- map events into sparse time series
- map events into itemset sequence data using time windows
... and use distance functions for these temporal data structures
