# Time series representations

- Goal: identify the structural elements of a time series
- automatically extract explanatory components of a time series using abstractions
- e.g. embeddings, spectral components...
- useful to tackle inherent idiosyncrasies of time series data analysis
- high dimensionality, noise and variability
- promote ability to measure distances between time series

- Two large families
- numeric representations: $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$
- symbolic representations: $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{x}_i \in \Sigma^p$
