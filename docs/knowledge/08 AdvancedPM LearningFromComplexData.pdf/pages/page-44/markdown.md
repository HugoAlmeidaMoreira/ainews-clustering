# Symbolic time series data

- Time series can be mapped into symbolic sequences (SAX, codebooks)
- Many research contributions from:
- bioinformatics (efficient analysis of DNA and protein sequences)
- information retrieval (efficient analysis of text data)
- Mining symbolic time series data is indeed similar to real-valued data:
- distance-based clustering, classification and regression
- distance metrics on strings, e.g. edit distance, Jaro-Winkler, Levenshtein
- associative clustering, classification and regression
- symbolic temporal patterns (instead of continuous motifs, patterns)
