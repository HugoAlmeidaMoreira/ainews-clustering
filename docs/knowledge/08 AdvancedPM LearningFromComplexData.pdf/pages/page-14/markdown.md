# Learning from temporal data

Five major options

1. traditional descriptors/predictors
- first: map temporal data into multivariate data
- retrieve statistics along time: centrality, variance, regression coefficients, percentiles...
- retrieve statistics along time windows (rolling mean and rolling variance) and discard temporal dependence between the statistics produced for each window
- learn embeddings: data representations using neural networks
- second: apply multivariate methods (clustering, pattern mining, NBs, DTs, RFs, SVMs, NNs, etc.)

2. distance-based descriptors/predictors
3. associative descriptors/predictors
4. deep descriptors/predictors
5. prompt-engineered LLM descriptors/predictors
