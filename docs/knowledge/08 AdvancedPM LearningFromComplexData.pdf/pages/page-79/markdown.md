# Spatiotemporal data mining: approaches

## Option 4: dedicated approaches

- spatial slicing over classical approaches to turn learning sensitive to space
- guarantee sensitivity to spatiotemporal dynamics
- annotate events or group observations in accordance with spatial partitions
- examples: Bayesian classifiers with probabilities conditional to class and location, tree-based classifiers with info gain also dependent on location
- grouping criteria:
- circles centered at reference features
- gridded cells
- min-cut partitions
- Voronoi diagrams
- dedicated learning algorithms to solve new tasks (e.g., location prediction)
