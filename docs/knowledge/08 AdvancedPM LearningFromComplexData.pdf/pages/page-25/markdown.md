# Learning from temporal data: LLM prompting

- Given a data-rich prompting...
can LLMs be used to extract features, learn descriptions and place predictions data?

- The answer largely depends on task complexity: use LLMs with great caution
- poor performance on hard, specialized tasks and even in some simple ones (e.g., attention to info in the text prompt may override the attached structured data)
- pros
- flexible, fast, task-adaptive without retraining
- works with missing, noisy, or heterogeneous data
- cons
- limited numerical precision and temporal grounding
- weak guarantees on predictive accuracy
- sensitive to prompt design and assumptions
