# Spatiotemporal data mining: approaches

- Option 2: use spatial-sensitive distances
Distanced-based learners – e.g. kNN, clustering and biclustering – over:
- observations with spatial attributes
- Euclidean, walking, driving, contiguity distance between two locations
- weighted attributes: relevance of spatial component (versus remaining)
- when an observation is a time series: combine time series distance with spatial distance
- trajectory data
- dedicated distances between two trajectories
- georeferenced event data
- distance between sets of spatial events (e.g. differences between spatiotemporal distributions)
- continuous spatiotemporal data:
- matrix distances (local or global) able to accommodate misalignments
