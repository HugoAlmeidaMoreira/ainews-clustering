# Spatiotemporal data mining

The process of discovering useful, non-trivial patterns from spatiotemporal data to support decisions
- spatiotemporal data prediction and clustering
- spatiotemporal outlier discovery (discontinuities, unexpected events/trends)
- spatiotemporal pattern mining

What's NOT spatial data mining
- querying (storing and indexing) spatial data
- ex. retrieve current traffic on the shortest path from Boston to Houston
- testing simple hypotheses (also referred as primary data analysis)
- ex. female chimpanzee territories are smaller than male territories
- SDM ≡ secondary data analysis: generate multiple plausible hypotheses
- uninteresting or obvious patterns in spatial data
- ex. rainfall in Minneapolis correlated with rainfall in St. Paul (10 miles apart)
