# Learning from temporal data: LLM prompting

- Prompting principles for descriptive tasks
- explicitly define temporal scope (time window, granularity)
- ask for trend-aware descriptions (seasonality, peaks, regime shifts)
- use structured outputs (tables, bullet summaries, timelines)
- on inferential tasks, encourage step-by-step temporal reasoning
- request explicit feature identification (lags, growth rates, volatility)
- compare multiple time windows or regimes

- Best suited for
- exploratory analysis, hypothesis generation, feature engineering support
- reporting, data quality assessment, model interpretability
