# Spatial clustering

- Different types
- clustering observations with spatial information (e.g., georeferenced vectors and series)
- clustering trajectories...
- Similarity measures
- distances combining non-spatial and spatial attributes
- topological: neighborhood EM (NEM) for joint partitioning feature space and space
- Interest measures
- spatial proximity
- cartographic generalization
- unusual density
- consistent feature-space (nearest neighbors in same cluster)
- Challenges
- temporal data (changing locations of an observation)
- spatial constraints in algorithmic design
