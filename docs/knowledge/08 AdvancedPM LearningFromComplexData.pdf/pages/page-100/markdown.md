# Summary

- Spatiotemporal data is pervasive: urban, social, healthcare, geophysical, deep space
- Learning from spatiotemporal structures: observation is a feature-vector, time series, trajectory
- observations are not independent (dependent): spatial auto-correlation and heterogeneity
- tasks: spatiotemporal pattern mining, outlier analysis, prediction, clustering
- Principles can be placed to learn from spatiotemporal data
- spatial slicing to learn spatial-aware descriptive and predictive models
- spatial-aware distances to weight non-spatial and spatial attributes
- discovery of spatiotemporal patterns (co-locations, associations, emerging patterns, flocks)
- Real data structures in public and private orgs are relational or multi-dimensional
- Mining relational and multi-dimensional data focused on a table (fact) of interest
- apply subspace clustering, generative modelling, multivariate time series analysis and tensor
- map into more adequate (temporal) data structures for the sequent application of classic TDM
- Relational data mining (RDM) dedicated to analyse data in multiple relations using ILP principles
