- Descriptive: learn NNs to denoise (autoenconding observations), extract features, impute...
- Precitive: end-to-end supervised learning
- TRAIN: learn expressive functions that map time-rich inputs and corresponding targets
- TEST: apply the function on testing observations and return the estimates
