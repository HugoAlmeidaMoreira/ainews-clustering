# Summary

- Temporal data are ubiquitous: measuring bio, individual, organizational and societal systems
- Application domains include the analysis of log data, medical records, user behavior, shapes, musical sheets, sensor data, text, Twitter, speech, user actions
- Mining temporal data commonly rely on one of four major paradigms:
- feature extraction followed by classic algorithms
- distance-based approaches with elastic distances (e.g. DTW)
- pattern mining following by associative analysis
- generative models (e.g. temporal neural networks)
- Symbolic and spectral representations (e.g. SAX, Fourier and Wavelet transforms) offer relevant abstractions to handle the idiosyncrasies of signal data
- Pattern mining in temporal data
- sequential pattern mining in sequence data
- biclustering, triclustering and motif discovery in (multivariate) time series data
- discovery of episodes, partial orders and event arragments over event sequences
