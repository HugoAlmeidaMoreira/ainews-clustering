# Relational data mining

## Relational data mining (RDM)
- analysis of data distributed in multiple relations

Multiple paradigms: classic, deep learning, prompt-based...
... yet many RDM principles come from inductive logic programming (ILP)
- ILP concerned with finding patterns expressed as logic programs
- initially: data modelling/description/synthesis
- in recent years: whole spectrum of data mining tasks
- ILP successes in commercial settings and scientific fields such as:
- chemistry/biology (toxicology, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra)
- traffic accident data
- survey data in medicine
- ecological biodegradation rates
