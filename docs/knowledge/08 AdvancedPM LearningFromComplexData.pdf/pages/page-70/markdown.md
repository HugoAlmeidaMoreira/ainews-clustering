# Spatiotemporal data mining: approaches

- Option 1: map spatial data into multivariate data
- observations with spatial variables
- consider latitude, longitude, elevation, radius as numeric variables
- whenever possible adapt distances to guarantee sensitivity to such variables
- e.g. $d$(location(customer), location(store))
- cluster geographies (nominal/ordinal variables)
- when an observation is a time series: combine time series statistics with spatial features
- trajectory data: statistics on trajectory
- georeferenced event data: statistics (spatiotemporal distribution)
- continuous spatiotemporal data: e.g. Wavelet and spectral features after spatial slicing
- Do not forget: neural embeddings and LLM prompt-based features as alternative representations
