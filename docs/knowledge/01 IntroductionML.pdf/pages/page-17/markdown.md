# Learning input-output functions

- Supervised learning
- with a teacher (that tells you the ground truth)
- learning from training data: pairs of inputs and outputs (labels, quantities, structures)

- Unsupervised learning
- without a teacher
- learning from training data without outputs (e.g. find associations, clusters/categories, anomalies)

- Reinforcement learning
- with a teacher (that highlights both good and bad outputs)
- learning rewards and penalties observed from sequence of decisions within a given environment
