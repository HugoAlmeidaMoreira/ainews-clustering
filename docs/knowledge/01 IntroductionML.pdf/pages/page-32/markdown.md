# Example: biomedicine

- clinical trials (cohort studies), e.g. case-control populations
- observations generally correspond to:
- individuals
- input variables: health-related features (clinical records, multi-omics, exposomics)
- output variable: outcome annotations
- qualitative conditions (diagnostics, prognostics, prescriptions, traits)
- quantifiable phenotypes (impairments, molecular markers, risk, survivability, drug dosage)
- hospitals, tissue samples, undertaken procedures, healthcare professionals, drugs...
- ability to generalize from a population to new observations
- prevent overfitting (including non-relevant relations in the learned models)
- prevent underfitting (excluding relevant relations from the learned models)
