# Example: biomedicine

- Statistical modeling: assess risk determinants, model health trajectories, test clinical hypotheses
- Clustering: group patients in accordance with biophysiological profile (e.g. stratified therapeutics)
- Pattern mining: discover meaningful associations to understand disease/therapeutic responses
- Outlier analysis: personalized care to particular needs (e.g. multimorbidity, rare diseases)
- Representation learning: encoders and saliency maps of medical signals/images/notes
- Generative modeling: comprehensive models of disease/treatment (e.g. health progression)
- Classification: how monitored inputs affect diagnostics/prognostics, therapeutic choices
- Regression: estimate risk, drug dosage or efficacy, quantifiable phenotypes
