# From experience to learning

- Recall: learning as a fundamental quality of intelligence
- "learning is any process by which a system improves performance from experience" (Herbert Simon)

- Experience recorded as data observations acquired from:
- multiple systems of the same type
- e.g. multiple individuals (cohorts), vehicles, computers, regions, organizations
- single system instance under different conditions
- e.g. brain under different stimuli, crop under different weather, e-commerce along time

- Learn from the experience (records): multiple data observations... statistics!
- discover relevant associations (patterning)
