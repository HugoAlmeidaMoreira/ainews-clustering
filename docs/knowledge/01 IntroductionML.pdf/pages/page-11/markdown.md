# Descriptive vs predictive learning

- Major ends of pattern recognition (learning from experience):
- understanding system behavior (descriptive learning)
- data ⇒ information ⇒ knowledge
- unsupervised learning: learning in the absence of outcomes of interest
- supervised learning: outcomes of interest can be used to guide description
- supporting decisions (predictive learning)
- data and outcomes ⇒ decision support system
- supervised or semi-supervised learning
- semi-supervised when outcomes are only known for a subset of all observations
