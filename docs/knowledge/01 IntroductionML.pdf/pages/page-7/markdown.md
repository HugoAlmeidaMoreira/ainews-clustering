# Systemic world view

- Everything is systemic:
- biological systems
- ecological systems
- societal systems
- mechanical systems
- digital systems
- quantum systems
- hybrid systems
- astrophysical systems

“we contain, are, interact and move within systems”

Psychoanalyst: Know the influence of the surrounding systems in our life and be free!

- The behavior of all these systems can be monitored (e.g. sensorization, observation)
