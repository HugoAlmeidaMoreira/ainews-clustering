# Mixed data

- A data space can be composed by **non-iid numeric variables**
- i.i.d. stands for **independent** and **identically distributed**
- two numeric variables may be correlated, i.e. not independent
- two numeric variables may have distinct distributions (e.g. $U(0,100)$ and $N(3,5)$), i.e. non-identically distributed

- Observations can have numeric, nominal and ordinal features
- we informally term such data as **mixed data**
- examples?
