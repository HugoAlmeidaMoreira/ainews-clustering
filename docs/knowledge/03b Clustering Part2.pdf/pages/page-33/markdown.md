# Statistical significance

- Why? need to robustly interpret measure
- if our measure of evaluation has the value, 10, is that good, fair, or poor? ⇒ p-value

- How? Compare the values of an index that result from a randomized dataset against the index values from the target cluster analysis
- If the value of the index is unlikely, then results are significant

- To test superiority between two clustering solutions, simpler statistical tests can be considered

- Interesting fact: the more "atypical" a clustering result is, the more likely it represents valid structure in the data
