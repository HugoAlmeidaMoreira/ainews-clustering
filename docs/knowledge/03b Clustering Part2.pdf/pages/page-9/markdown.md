# Handling complex data structures

Two major paradigms

- dedicated distances for series/image/text/events (see previous class!)
- feature extraction to map complex data structures into tabular data
- manual extraction often incomplete and error-prone
- automated extraction susceptible to diverse idiosyncrasies
- examples: statistics on a sliding window for time series, structure–texture–color cues for images, term frequencies for text, geometric features for trajectories...
- problem: feature extraction and subsequent engineering entail 90% of overall ML effort!
- solution: learn representations
- "A good representation is one that makes subsequent learning task easier" Goodfellow et al. 2016 (including clustering!)
