# Pre- and post-processing

## Pre-processing
- normalize data
- data reduction and transformation
- remove outliers

## Post-processing
- eliminate small clusters that may represent outliers
- split 'loose' clusters (clusters with relatively high SSE)
- merge clusters that are 'close' (clusters with relatively low SSE)
- these steps can be integrated within the clustering process
