# Approaches

## Partitioning $\Leftarrow$
- Create partitions and iteratively update them (e.g. $k$-means, $k$-modes, $k$-medoids)

## Hierarchical
- Create hierarchical decomposition of data points

## Density-based
- Group points based on connectivity and density functions

## Model-based $\Leftarrow$
- Data are seen as a mixture of distributions (e.g. EM)

## Deep learning $\Leftarrow$
- End-to-end neural networks for high-efficacy clustering
