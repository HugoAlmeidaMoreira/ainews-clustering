# Clustering modes

- Deterministic versus probabilistic cluster stances
- **hard** solutions: each observation either belongs or not to a given cluster
- **soft** solutions: each observation has a probability (membership) of belonging to a given cluster
- fuzzy and model-based clustering
- Separation of clusters: **exclusive** versus **non-exclusive** (overlapping clusters)
- **Complete** versus **partial** (observations may not belong to any cluster)
- Uniform versus weighted
- variables can be weighted based on data semantics/domain knowledge
- observations can be weighted based on relevance criteria
