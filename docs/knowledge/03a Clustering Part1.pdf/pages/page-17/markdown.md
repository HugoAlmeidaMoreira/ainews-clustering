# Correlation

- positive (negative): two variables vary in the same (opposite) way
- maximum value of 1 (-1) if X and Y are perfectly direct (inverse) correlated
- recall: Pearson and Spearman coefficients for numeric data
- how to handle categorical or mixed data?
- example: gene expression data clustering

$$
\begin{array}{l}
g1 = (1,2,3,4,5) \\
g2 = (100,200,300,400,500) \\
g3 = (5,4,3,2,1) \\
\end{array}
$$

Which genes are similar according to correlation coefficients?
