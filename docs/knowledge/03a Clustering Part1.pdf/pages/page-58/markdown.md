# Recall: clustering evaluation

- 3 kinds of measures: external, internal and relative indexes
- External (supervised): extent to which cluster labels match true labels
- requires prior or expert knowledge
- Internal (unsupervised): goodness without external information
- how well they are separated (e.g. silhouette)
- should be independent from algorithm-specific functions (unbiased)
- Relative: compare different cluster analyses (different parameters/algorithms)
