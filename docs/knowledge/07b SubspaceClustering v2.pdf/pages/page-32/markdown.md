# Approaches

- Number of biclusters at a time
- discover one bicluster at a time and then mask it
- discover a set of biclusters at a time

- Optimality
- exhaustive and (quasi-)exhaustive searches
- e.g. find heavy subgraphs in bipartite graphs mapped from data
- heavy! Place restrictions on structure, coherence and quality
- approximate searches (next slide)
