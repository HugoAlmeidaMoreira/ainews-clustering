# Applications: biomedicine

- Omic data: functional processes and pathways (X=genes/proteins/metabolites, Y=conditions)
- Physiological data: coherent sliding features on a subset of stimuli-elicited responses; groups of patients with shared local patterns (X=signals, Y=features)
- Clinical data: health trends and risk profiles from health records; individuals with similar treatments, diagnoses and tests (X=individuals, Y=clinical features)
- Genomic mutations: correlated mutations (Y) for specific populations (X)
- Biological networks: modules of genes, proteins or metabolites (X=Y=biological entities) with cohesive local interaction using adjacency matrices
