# Statistical significance

Is a bicluster unexpected?

- e.g. Is a bicluster defined by 2 observations and 2 variables in large dataset interesting? Or does it occur by chance?
- Solution: assess statistical significance
- randomize data several times and compute the ratio of datasets where we are able to find a similar bicluster
- approximate data distributions and perform a statistical test
- the null hypothesis is that the bicluster does not occur by chance
- we can statistically test its support using binomial test similarly as we did for itemsets
- Assessment can be considered during the biclustering search
- Refresh memory: False positive bicluster? False negative bicluster?
