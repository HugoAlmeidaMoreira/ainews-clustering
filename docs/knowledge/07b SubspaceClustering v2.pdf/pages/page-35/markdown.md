# Time series biclustering

- Until here: biclustering as relevant pattern discovery task for multivariate data, yet...
- applicability to (univariate) time series data is equally pervasive
- a bicluster is defined by a subset of **observations** and **time points**
- contiguity is generally assumed across time points (convex temporal pattern)
- temporal misalignments between observations can be further accommodated
- e.g. individuals at different stages of a disease

- Illustrative method: CCC identifies patterns in linear complexity time using suffix trees
- eCCC extension can further allow temporal misalignments and noise
