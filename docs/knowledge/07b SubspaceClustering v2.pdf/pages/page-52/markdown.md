# Summary

- Subspace clustering is key to find **non-trivial patterns** on **real-valued data**
- unsupervised exploration of **high-dimensional data** (focus on subspaces)
- Subspace clusters satisfy specific criteria of homogeneity and statistical significance
- **Merit functions** determine the homogeneity (patterns of interest)
- condition the structure, coherence and quality (noise tolerance) of patterns
- **Statistically significant** patterns are unexpected (low $p$-value)
- **Coherence** defines the underlying assumption (constant, additive, order-preserving...) and strength
- The **structure** is determined by the number, shape and positioning of patterns
- Subspace clustering **searches** can be classified in exhaustive, greedy, and parametric
