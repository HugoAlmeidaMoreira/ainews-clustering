# Why subspace clustering?

- Find patterns on real-valued data
- classic pattern mining (e.g. FIM, ARM) suffer from discretization drawbacks
- Find less-trivial patterns with non-constant homogeneity
- classic pattern mining is only able to find constant patterns (i.e. simple repetitions)
- Other applications
- well-established role in predictive tasks using discriminative patterns
- dimensionality reduction by reducing data into a set of informative or/and discriminative subspaces
- imputation of missings taking into consideration a subspace's homogeneity
