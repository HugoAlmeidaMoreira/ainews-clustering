# Motivation

- GLOBAL stance: clustering
- Group observations correlated according to values of all variables
- Problem?
- High-dimensional data: hundreds to thousands of variables
Similarity on all variables can be misleading if strong correlation occurs only on a subset
x1 = 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.4 0.7 0.4 0.3
x2 = 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.7 0.4 0.2
x3 = 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.7 0.4 0.1
Dissimilar? What about this coherent pattern

- Solution? LOCAL stance: subspace clustering
- Group observations correlated on a subset of all variables (subspace)
- Non-exhaustive and overlapping groups of observations
