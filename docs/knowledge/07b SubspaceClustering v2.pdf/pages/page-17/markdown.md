# Multiplicative model

- Similar to the additive model:
- on observations
$$
a_{ij} = c_j \gamma_i + \eta_{ij}
$$
- on variables
$$
a_{ij} = c_i \gamma_j + \eta_{ij}
$$

|  $\gamma_1 = 2$  |
| --- |
|  $\gamma_2 = -1$  |
|  $\gamma_3 = 1$  |
|  $c_1 = 1$ | $c_2 = -3$ | $c_3 = 2$  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  2 | -6 | 4  |
|  2 | 3 | 2  |
|  1 | 2 | 2  |
|  4 | 1 | 2  |

- $c_j$ (or $c_i$) is the value of variable $y_j$ (or observation $x_i$)
- $\gamma_i$ (or $\gamma_j$) is the adjustment for observation $x_i$ (or variable $y_j$)
