# Triclustering

- Applications
- computational biology: regulation (genes × conditions × time), protein–protein interaction (proteins × interaction × conditions), drug response profiling (cell lines × drugs × dosages)
- recommender systems: dynamic preference modeling (users × items × time/location/device)
- NLP: topic discovery (documents × terms × time/language), sentiment analysis with context
- social networks: community detection with context, role discovery in dynamic networks
- time series: segmentation (sensors × signals × time windows), EEG analysis, climate monitoring
- vision: video analysis (objects × features × frames), activity recognition, multimodal systems
- business: sales patterns (products × stores × time), fraud detection, basket analysis with season
- healthcare: patient stratification (patients × variables × time), treatment outcome, epidemiology

- Challenge: extend previous concepts on biclustering after reading the survey by Henriques et al. (2017)
