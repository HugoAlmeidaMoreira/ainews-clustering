# Order-preserving model

- A bicluster following an order-preserving model is (I, J) where the values on each observation in I across the J variables are ordered according the same permutation $\pi$

|   | y_{1} | y_{2} | y_{3} | y_{4}  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  x_{1} | 19 | 12 | 6 | 14  |
|  x_{2} | 10 | 7 | 13 | 9  |
|  x_{3} | 11 | 6 | 17 | 8  |
|  x_{4} | 13 | 4 | 1 | 11  |

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\pi = y_1 \geq y_4 \geq y_2 \\
B = (\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}, \{y_1, y_2, y_4\})
\end{array}
$$

## Why?

- More flexible and noise robust
- Focus on orderings instead of absolute values (preferences, difficulties)
