# Motivation

Consider **gene expression** data analysis (where $X =$ samples/individuals and $Y =$ genes)

- **clustering** groups samples or genes $\Rightarrow$ limited relevance! **Why?**
- only a small set of the genes participates in a cellular process of interest
- an interesting cellular process is active only in a subset of the conditions
- a single gene may participate in multiple pathways that may or not be coactive under all conditions

- **biclustering** groups genes that show similar activity patterns under a subset of samples =&gt; **current way of extracting new knowledge**
- SARS-CoV-2 knowledge advances on regulatory responses and vaccines
- breakthroughs on cancer mechanisms and therapies
