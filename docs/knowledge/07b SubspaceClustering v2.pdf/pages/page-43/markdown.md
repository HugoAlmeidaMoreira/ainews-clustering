# Patterns and deep learning?

- Handling complex neural networks?
- multimodal architectures
- extension to shared spaces: latent patterns embody relationships across data modalities
- transformer-based architectures
- attention weights ≈ pattern importance
- attention heads ≈ distinct patterns

- Core problem: neural networks only able to generate implicit patterns
- limited pattern deidentification
- limited post-hoc explainability on the deidentified patterns
