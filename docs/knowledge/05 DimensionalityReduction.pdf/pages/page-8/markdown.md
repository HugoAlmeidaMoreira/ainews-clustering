# Dimensionality reduction

Some goals of dimensionality reduction:

- Guide supervised learning (focus on discriminative regions)
- Guide unsupervised learning (focus on informative regions)
- Visualization (project high-dim data into interpretable low-dim data)
- Data compression (efficient storage and retrieval)
- Noise removal (denoising data)
- Speed-up learning
- Describe the underlying properties of data
- Guarantee simplicity and comprehensibility of mined results
- Map multimedia data (image and signal data) into feature-based data
- Support matrix operations (inverse, rank determination, approximation)...
