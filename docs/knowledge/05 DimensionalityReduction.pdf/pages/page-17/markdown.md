# Information measures in description

- as a **filter**: measure feature importance and select top-$k$ features or above threshold
- **unsupervised** setting: **high entropy**
- supervised setting: **next slides**
- as a **wrapper**: assess learning performance with varying subsets of features
- simple: measure feature importance and test descriptors on top-$k$ features with varying $k$
- advanced: assess descriptors with different subsets of variables (irrespectively of top-$k$)
- how to assess descriptors?
- e.g. clustering quality – any problem when considering silhouette?
