# Motivation

- At a first glimpse, increasing the number of variables should improve learning...
- In practice, including more variables can degrade performance (i.e. **curse of dimensionality**)
- challenges: learning complexity and generalization difficulty (over/underfitting)
- common definition of **high-dimensionality**: $|Y| \gg |X|$ (i.e. $m \gg n$)
- The number of training observations required increases **exponentially** with dimensionality
- How then can we learn in high-dimensional data spaces with a limited number of observations?
- dimensionality reduction
