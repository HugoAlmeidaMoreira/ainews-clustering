# Dimensionality reduction

- Project the $m$-dimensional observations into a $k$-dimensional space $(k \ll m)$
- preserve most of relevant information or structure from data
- Solve the learning problem in low dimensions
- Two major approaches
- feature selection
- choosing a subset of all features
$$
[y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m] \rightarrow [y_{i1}, y_{i2}, \dots, y_{ik}]
$$
- feature extraction
- creating new features by combining existing ones
$$
[y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m] \rightarrow [d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k] \quad \text{using} \quad f([y_{i1}, y_{i2}, \dots, y_{im}])
$$
