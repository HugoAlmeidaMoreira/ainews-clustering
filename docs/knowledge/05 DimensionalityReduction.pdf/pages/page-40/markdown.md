# Compression

- Goal: compress data without information loss
- Why? Remember...
- description
- compactness, interpretability, simplicity
- transforms can be used to explain relevant information (variable dependencies)
- how? Assess which variables are contributing more to each component
- remember a component is a linear composition of variables
- guide prediction on the compressed data space
- denoising data
- efficient data storage, retrieval, learning
