# Evaluation of low-dimensional spaces

- Direct metrics
- match scores against a reference set features/subspaces (only suitable for artificial data or data with prior knowledge)

- Indirect evaluation
- Learning on the original versus reduced data space (e.g., predictive accuracy, goodness of resulting clusters)
- before-and-after comparison
- comparison using different learning algorithms
- Reconstruction error
- Learning curves
