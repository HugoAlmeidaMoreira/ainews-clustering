# Singular value decomposition (SVD)

![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

$1^{\text{st}}$ singular vector: direction of maximal variance
$\lambda_{1}$: how much data variance is explained by $1^{\text{st}}$ vector
$2^{\text{nd}}$ singular vector: direction of maximal variance, after removing projection of $1^{\text{st}}$ vector
$\lambda_{2}$: how much data variance is explained by the $2^{\text{nd}}$ vector

...

$k^{\text{th}}$ singular vector ...

(until unexplained variance below threshold)
