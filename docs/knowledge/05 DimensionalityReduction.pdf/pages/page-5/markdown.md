# Challenges

High-dimensional data analysis:
- learning complexity: large data space
- generalization difficulty (insufficient observations)
- overfitting risk
- underfitting risk
- how to evaluate these risks?
- behavior for varying data size
- compare training and testing error
- variability of errors across testing folds
- bias and variance components of error
