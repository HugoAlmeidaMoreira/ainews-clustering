# Feature extraction

Feature extraction used to

- extract relevant features from complex data to handle structural complexity
- learn transformations that explain simple multivariate data with reduced dimensionality: TODAY!
- classical approaches aim at finding a linear transformation
- Why? simple to compute and analytically tractable
- Goal: reduction that preserves as much information in data as possible
- paradigmatic case: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- simple extensions available
- non-linear transformations (kernel trick)
- accommodate discriminative power in supervised settings
- Goal: reduction that best separates the data
- paradigmatic case: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
