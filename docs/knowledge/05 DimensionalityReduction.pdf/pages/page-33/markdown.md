# Principal component analysis

- PCA projects data along the directions where the data varies most
- directions are determined by the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues
- reduction can imply information loss, yet PCA preserves as much information as possible

- Components (summary variables)
- linear combinations of the original variables
- uncorrelated with each other
- the largest eigenvalues are called **principal components**
- the eigenvalue is the magnitude of eigenvector, defining the direction's variance
- in general: only few components needed to capture most data variability
