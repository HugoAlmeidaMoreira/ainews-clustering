# Data reduction

Dimensionality reduction is one of the multiple forms of data reduction
- data reduction similarly considered to aid learning and time-memory efficiency

## Other data reduction strategies:

- domain reduction: reduce data representation
- binning/discretization of real-valued attributes, e.g. continuous variable onto ranges
- cardinality reduction of nominal and ordinal attributes: aggregating categories
- data size reduction (subsampling): reduce the number of instances
1. simple random subsample (SRS): randomly remove observations (either without or with replacement)
2. balanced sample: remove observations guaranteeing that the reduced data satisfies a predefined criterion (e.g. balanced number of classes)
