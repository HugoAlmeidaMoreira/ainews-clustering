# Feature selection

- Optimal subset of features according to an objective function
- differs from feature extraction where output features are (non-)linear combinations of original features

- Objective criteria
- unsupervised setting: variables with higher variability and entropy
- supervised setting: maximize discrimination/correlation with target variable

- Perspectives
- subset search vs. feature ranking
- models: filter vs. wrapper
