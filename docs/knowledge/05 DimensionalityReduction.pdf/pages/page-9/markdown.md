# How?

1. Feature selection
2. Feature extraction/transformation
- principal component analysis
- linear discriminant analysis
- representation learning
3. Sparse kernels and regularization in parametric models to exclude non-relevant parameters
- neural networks, support vector machines, discriminant analysis...
4. Subspace selection to jointly select variables and observations
- pattern mining, decision trees and random forests
- associative classifiers and decision tables
