# Data reduction

## Subsampling (continue)

3. stratified sample: observations are divided into mutually disjointed parts, called strata, and removal (SRS) is done at each stratum
4. data clustering
- clustering the data and use centroids instead of the actual data
5. data condensation
- obtain minimal data set for correctly classifying all original observations
- emerges from the fact that naive sampling (random or stratified sampling) is not suitable to learn from noisy data (dependent on algorithms)
6. data squashing
- compress ("squash") data in such a way that a statistical analysis carried out on the compressed or original data yields the same outcome
