# Types of outliers (1/2)

- Global outlier (or point anomaly)
- observation that significantly deviates from the rest of the data (e.g. intrusion)
- issue: find an appropriate measurement of deviation

- Contextual outlier (or conditional outlier)
- observation that significantly deviates from a given context
- e.g. 30°C in Urbana outlier depending on whether is summer or winter?
- variables divided into two groups
- contextual variables: define the context (e.g. time, location)
- behavioral variables: define the features for outlier evaluation (e.g. temperature)
- generalization of local outliers—deviation from its local area
- issue: define or formulate meaningful context
