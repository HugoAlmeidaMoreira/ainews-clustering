# Outlier analysis: unsupervised methods

## Unsupervised outlier detection

- observations "clustered" into groups, each with unique properties
- outlier is far away from any group of normal objects
- e.g. intrusion or virus detection, normal activities are diverse

- Weakness
- unsupervised methods may have high false positive rate but still miss many real outliers (supervised often more effective)
- cannot detect collective outliers effectively

- How? find clusters, then outliers are isolated observations and small clusters
- problem 1: hard to distinguish noise from outliers
- problem 2: costly (clustering all data when only few are outliers)
