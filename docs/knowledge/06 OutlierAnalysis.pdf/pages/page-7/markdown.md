# Challenges

- Separating normal observations from outliers
- hard to enumerate all possible normal behaviours
- border between normal and outlier objects is often a gray area

- Application-specific
- distance metric or statistical assumptions are application-dependent (e.g. clinic data and small deviations, marketing and larger fluctuations)

- Handling noise
- noise may distort the normal objects

- Understandability
- explanatory detection
- degree of outlier: likelihood of being generated by a normal mechanism
