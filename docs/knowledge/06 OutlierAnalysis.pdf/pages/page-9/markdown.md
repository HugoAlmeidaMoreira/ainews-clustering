# Outlier analysis

- Our core premises
- data is preprocessed (e.g., minimum artifacts/missings, numerical encodings of ordinals)
- access to good representations of (complex) data ⇒ check representation learning class
- controlled dimensionality of observations ⇒ check statistics and dim. reduction classes

- Two ways of categorizing outlier detection approaches:
- whether labeled examples of outliers are given
- supervised, semi-supervised vs. unsupervised methods
- whether assumptions/knowledge w.r.t. data are available
- statistical, proximity-based, and clustering-based methods vs. deep learning
