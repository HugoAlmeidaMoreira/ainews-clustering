# Statistical-based approaches

Learn model fitting data, and identify objects in low probability regions

- Two categories
- parametric: distribution-based
- non-parametric: histogram-based and depth-based

- Strengths
- common and effective: many data distributions are well-approximated

- Weakness
- distribution-based: assume the distribution is known
- histogram/depth-based: overfitting to available data
