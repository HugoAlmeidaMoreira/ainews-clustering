# Proximity-based approaches

- Intuition: observations that are far away from the others are outliers
- Assumption: the proximity of an outlier deviates significantly from that of most of the others in the data set
- Two types of proximity-based outlier detection methods
- distance-based outlier detection:
an observation is an outlier if its neighborhood does not have enough other observations
- density-based outlier detection:
an observation is an outlier if its density is relatively lower than that of its neighbors
