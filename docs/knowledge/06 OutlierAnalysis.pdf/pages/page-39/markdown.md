# Summary

- Outlier analysis aims to detect observations deviating from expectations
- outliers either inconsistent with the rest data (global) or neighbors (local)
- outliers can deviate in a given context, and appear in a group (collective)

- Given labeled examples, outlier analysis can be solved using **classification** with imbalanced classes (supervised) or guided by **semi-supervised** clustering

- **Statistical** approaches assume data is generated by a distribution to test the likelihood of an observation to be generated by the approximated distribution

- In **proximity-based** approaches, outliers have distant nearest neighbors or a density differs from the density around neighbors

- Small, compact **clusters** or unclustered observations also seen as outliers

- **Deep learning** offer expressive measures of unexpected behaviors from **reconstruction loss**

- Variants of outlier analysis for temporal data and high-dimensional data
