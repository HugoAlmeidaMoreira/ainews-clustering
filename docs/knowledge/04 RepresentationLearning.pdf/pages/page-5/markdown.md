# Representation Learning

- Core premises
- observed data is a causal result of underlying factors
- variation in these factors explain the variation in the data
- Example: objects, rotation, lightning, etc. are underlying factors of images

- Why learning representations?
- feature extraction from complex data structures (e.g., text, time series, image, events)
- less dependence on feature engineering and domain knowledge
- easy application of machine learning (controlled dimensionality, feature independence)
- improved descriptive and predictive capacity
- others: denoising, summarization, visualization...
