# Supervised data representations

- The first school seems a natural choice...
- extracts features in a latent space (hidden layer) with inherent predictive value for a selected task

- Problems
- discriminative yet not necessarily descriptive
- unable to represent/reconstruct input
- no guarantees of smoothness, invariance
- biased towards the target predictive task

- Solutions
- multi-task learning stances
- extend the number of outputs to capture multiple tasks
- features become less biased and more informative towards varying ends
- unsupervised learning stances ⇒ next!
