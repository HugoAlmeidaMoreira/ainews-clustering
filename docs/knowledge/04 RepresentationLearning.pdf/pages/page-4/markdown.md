# Representation Learning

However... feature extraction is now always trivial

- manual extraction is laborious, often incomplete and prone to errors (e.g., features derived from EEG visual inspection)
- automated extraction pipelines not always good to handle complex data
- statistics on a sliding window for time series, structure-texture-color cues for images, term frequencies for text, geometric features for trajectories...
- ... are often uninformative and susceptible to diverse idiosyncrasies
