# Multi-dimensional associations

- Single-dimensional rules:
- buys(X, milk) ⇒ buys(X, bread)
- Multi-dimensional rules: ≥2 dimensions or predicates
- Inter-dimension association rules (no repeated predicates)
- age(X, [19,25]) ∧ occupation(X, student) ⇒ buys(X, coke)
- Hybrid-dimension association rules (repeated predicates)
- age(X, [19,25]) ∧ buys(X, popcorn) ⇒ buys(X, coke)
- How to? Data cube approaches
