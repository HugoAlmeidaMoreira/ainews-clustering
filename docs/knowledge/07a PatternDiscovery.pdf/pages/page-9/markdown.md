# Why mining patterns?

- Acquiring knowledge from non-trivial and actionable patterns
- classic: basket analysis, cross-marketing, web navigation, DNA sequence analysis, catalog design, sales campaign...
- Patterns further form the foundation for many essential data mining tasks
- multivariate association and causality analysis
- feature extraction from complex data
- e.g. patterns in media, spatiotemporal, stream data as features
- prediction: associative classifiers and regressors
- clustering: pattern-based clustering (e.g. shapelet-based clustering)
- semantic data compression (e.g. fascicles)
