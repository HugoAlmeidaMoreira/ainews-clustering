# Rare and negative patterns

- Why to solely pursue unexpectedly frequent patterns (aka positive patterns)?
- As we moved from clusters to anomalies...
... we can move from unexpectedly frequent to unexpectedly infrequent patterns

- Rare patterns
- very low support but interesting (e.g. buying diamond)

- Negative pattern
- patterns that are unexpectedly rare (instead of frequent)
- example: buying Ford Expedition (SUV car) and Toyota Prius (hybrid car) together is unlikely since Ford Expedition and Toyota Prius are negatively correlated
- rare/infrequent negative patterns can even be more interesting than frequent ones!
