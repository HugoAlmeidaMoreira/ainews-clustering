# Pattern Recognition

- Patterns are local relationships in data, often yielding informative and predictive power
- statistical regularities: correlations, trends, discriminative associations...
- structural relationships: sequences, hierarchies, spatiotemporal layouts (e.g. word order in text, shapes in images)...
- latent representations: hidden features that efficiently summarize content...
- Locality in reference to the extent of the content space (e.g., subset of features, time, text, space)
- Pattern recognition underlies all learning tasks by humans and machines
- prediction: patterning used for driving? Image classification? Question answering?
- description: patterning used for clustering behaviors? Describing series? Detecting outliers?
