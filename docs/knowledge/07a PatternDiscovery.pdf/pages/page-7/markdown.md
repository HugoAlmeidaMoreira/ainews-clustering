# Pattern Discovery

- From now on: **patterns** as local relationships in data that are both *explicit* and *relevant*
- What makes a pattern **relevant**?
- statistical significance (# spurious)
- actionability (ability to be used to guide decisions in a given domain)
- non-triviality and novelty (can expand existing knowledge)
- informative power (e.g. summarization capacity) and/or predictive power
- non-redundancy (with other patterns in voluminous solutions)
- Pattern mining: discovery of all relevant patterns in a given dataset
