# Pattern Discovery

- Patterns form the ground for knowledge acquisition
- yet, to this end, we need to be able to access and interpret them
- problem: many patterns in ML are not clearly defined or easily interpretable (e.g. latent patterning in neural networks)

- Two paradigms: recognition of implicit versus explicit patterns
- for descriptive ends: we want to move toward explicit patterns
- well-defined and human-understandable (easy to inspect and validate)
- e.g. if-then rules in decision trees, handcrafted features (e.g. "knee angle &gt; θ"), ...
- Pattern discovery: subfield of ML dedicated to the retrieval of (explicit) patterns
