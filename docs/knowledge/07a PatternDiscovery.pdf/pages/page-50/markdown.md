# Remarks

- Until here... we have tapped into patterns in multivariate and transactional data structures
- Two notes of care
- check if pattern discovery offers a way to answer your problem
- remember that pattern discovery is primarily used for **descriptive ends** ⇒ check next slide
- although it can be used for **predictive ends** ⇒ check next class (associative learning)
- methods can be hard to scale for high-dimensional data with extensive feature dependencies
- practical principles to boost the search
- reduce dimensionality
- handle redundant variables (remove, combine...)
- remove highly frequent categories
- when discretizing data opt for qcut (equal frequency) over cut (equal width)
