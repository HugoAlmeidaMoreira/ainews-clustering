# Colossal patterns

- Colossal patterns are lengthy patterns
- generally yield higher importance than small patterns
- Many real-world tasks need mining colossal patterns
- high-dimensional data domains (biomedicine, text/media, social networks...)
- Problem: a subpattern of a frequent pattern is frequent, data with lengthy patterns have an explosive set of patterns 😊
- the downward property of classical approaches is insufficient
- whether we use breadth-first search (e.g. Apriori) or depth-first search (e.g. FPgrowth)
- closed/maximal patterns partially alleviate, yet not solve
- still need to find scattered large patterns
