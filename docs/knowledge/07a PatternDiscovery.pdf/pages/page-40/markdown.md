# Quantitative and multi-level associations

- Major problems of classic pattern mining?
- unable to deal with **numeric data**
- solution: discretization
- problems?
- discretization is susceptible to item-boundary problems
- loss of expressivity
- unable to handle with the **multi-level** and **multi-dimensional** structure of data
- e.g. different types of potatoes, different milk brands – generalize or specialize?

- Handling these problems
- **biclustering** (next class!) and **quantitative associations**
- multi-level and multi-dimensional associations
