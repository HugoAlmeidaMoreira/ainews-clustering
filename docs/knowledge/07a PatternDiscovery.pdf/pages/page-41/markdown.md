# Quantitative associations

- Simplistic preprocessing strategies
- static discretization based on predefined concept hierarchies (manual)
- dynamic discretization
- based on variable distribution (simple)
- such that the confidence or compactness of the rules mined is maximized (advanced)
- one-dimensional clustering: distance-based association
- Under these strategies, classic pattern mining is applied on the found numeric ranges
- problems of discretization?
- what about non-constant patterns?
- to be covered in the next class
