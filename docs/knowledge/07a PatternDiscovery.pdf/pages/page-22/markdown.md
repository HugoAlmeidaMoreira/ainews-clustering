# Association rules in multivariate data

Association have been further classified into different categories:

- Boolean association rule
$$
\text{Keyboard} \Rightarrow \text{Mouse} [\sup=6\%, \text{conf}=70\%]
$$
- the choice in transactional, sequential and categorical multivariate data

- Quantitative association rule
$$
\text{Age} \in [26,30] \Rightarrow \text{Cars} \in \{1,2\} [\sup=3\%, \text{conf}=36\%]
$$
- the choice in numeric data

- Hybrid association rules
$$
\text{Age} \in [26,30] \land \text{Keyboard} \Rightarrow \text{Mouse} \in \{1,2\}
$$
- the choice in mixed multivariate data, transactions with numeric outcomes, etc.
