# Remarks

Check if explicit patterns are the best solution to our problem! An illustrative example:

- Recommendation problems span our daily lives: shopping, media, webpage, document suggestions ... and pattern discovery can be used to retrieved frequently co-accessed, co-bought, co-liked items 😊
- Yet... not all recommendation tasks need to be answered using pattern discovery
- we need to separate description (knowledge acquisition) from prediction
- user-specific recommendations can be answered using predictive tasks
- predict a set of outputs from a set of input features that characterize user behavior
- each output corresponds to a measure interest (binary/numeric) of a user on a given item
- items/outputs are then ranked based on the estimated interest to deliver recommendations
- what about recommendations not custom to single users (e.g. market shelf display, privacy-aware web navigation rules...)? Yes, patterns offer here important rules and descriptive insights!
- Yet our preferences change over time, so...
