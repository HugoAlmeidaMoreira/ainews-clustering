# Association rule mining

- Association rules can be exhaustively generated from the found patterns with PM approaches
- efficiently combine disjoint patterns on the antecedent/consequent
- efficiently test interestingness criteria
- Upper bounds to the pattern length in the consequent can be imposed
- What if we have outcomes of interest?
- patterns can be found within each outcome-conditional dataset
- yet one pattern can be statistically significant for multiple outcomes
- solution: post-test the discriminative power of each rule $P \Rightarrow$ outcome (e.g. lift)
- straightforward PM extension to impose variables of interest to appear in the consequent
