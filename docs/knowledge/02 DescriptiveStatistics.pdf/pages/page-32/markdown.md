# Classical multivariate statistics

How to account for the associative aspects (dependencies) between multiple variables?

- **unsupervised setting**: we will delve into classical multivariate statistics throughout our module
- multi-wise associations between input variables
- they will be our baseline solutions to mine clusters, patterns, anomalies...
- **supervised setting**: recall the content of other DASH modules
- starting point: linear, ordinal, logistic regression for predictive tasks
- numeric, ordinal and nominal outputs, respectively
- way of assessing the relevance of each input variable given a set covariates (e.g. confounding factors)
