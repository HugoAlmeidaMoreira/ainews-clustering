# Classical statistics vs intelligence

- I have a **data-rich problem** at hands. What to do next?
- understanding and translating the problem into an appropriate task is the most critical step
- simple statistics vs intelligence? "do not use a cannon to kill a mosquito"

- Choose **classical statistics** when:
- the primary goal is **associative analysis**, **inference**, or **hypothesis testing**
- you need **confidence intervals**, $p$-values, **sample size** estimates, **uncertainty bounds**
- relationships in data are **simple** or **theoretically motivated**
- **assumptions** (linearity, normality, independence) are reasonable
- classical **feature extraction** is sufficient (e.g. sliding statistics from signals, spectrograms from images, term frequencies from text...)
