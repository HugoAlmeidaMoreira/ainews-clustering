# Hypothesis testing

- Evaluate evidence against a null hypothesis using sample data
- whether observed effects are likely due to chance vs statistically significant

- Hypothesis:
- null (H₀): no effect, no difference, or no association
- alternative (H₁): an effect, difference, or association exists

- Decision: given a predefined significance threshold (commonly α = 0.05)
- p ≤ α → Reject H₀ (evidence against the null)
- p &gt; α → Fail to reject H₀ (insufficient evidence)

- Example: test whether model M₁ is superior than M₂ using performance estimates:
- p = 1E-4 → reject no difference, i.e. statistically significant superiority given the collected estimates
- p = 0.1 → insufficient evidence
