# Univariate data analysis

- Irrespectively of the goal, **statistics** helps us understand data
- hearing our dataset is always the first important step!
- stances: univariate → bivariate → multivariate

- Random/aleatory variable
- function $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{E}$ from a sample space $\Omega$ to a measurable space $\mathbb{E}$
- e.g. height variable is a function that maps a person from a population $\Omega$ to a height in $\mathbb{R}^+$ ($\mathbb{E} = \mathbb{R}^+$)
- the observed height is referred as a measurement/feature
- from now one, we will refer a random variable simply as variable

- Univariate data analysis: single input variable
- comprises univariate data statistics or, in the presence of an output variable, bivariate data statistics

- Multivariate data analysis: multiple input variables
- multivariate order = number of input variables
