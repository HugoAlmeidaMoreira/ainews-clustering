# Classical statistics vs intelligence

- Choose **machine learning** when:
- the goal is **prediction** or **description** with the highest **efficacy** and generalization capacity
- system dynamics or relationships in data are highly **complex, noisy** or **unknown**
- data is **high-dimensional** with non-linear associations
- **feature extraction** is difficult or unclear

- Also recall: **learning** is just one of many forms of intelligence! Some problems better suited to:
- **rationality**: data-centric optimization, simulation, control, planning...
- **emotional intelligence**: data-grounded sensing, reasoning, expression of/under affective states...
- **social intelligence**: swarm intelligence for hard data-intensive tasks, agent communication...
- **hybrid**: combining forms of intelligence to solve challenging problems (e.g. self-driving cars)

- Follow classes to exercise and deepen this thinking with your project case studies!
