# Spearman rank

- Non-parametric coefficient
- works with rankings instead of absolute values
- How?
1. rank the values of $y_1$ and $y_2$
2. apply the Pearson correlation
- In the given example:
$$
r_s = PCC([5,6,1.5,3.5,3.5,7,1.5], [3,5.5,7,5.5,4,2,1]) = -0.17
$$
where $r_s$ is the magnitude of association
