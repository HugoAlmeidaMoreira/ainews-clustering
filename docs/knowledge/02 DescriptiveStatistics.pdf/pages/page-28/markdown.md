# Hypothesis testing

- You can test nearly anything...
- the fitting of theoretical distributions, outlier values, associations between variables
- and yes... correlations
- test: the population correlation ($\rho$) differs from zero ($H_0: \rho = 0$)
- low $p$-value indicate that the correlation is statistically significant
- high correlation coefficients can have low $p$-values
- low sample sizes, high variability create uncertainty
- similarly, small correlations can be statistically significant (interesting!)
- takeaway: always collect the $p$-value in addition to the coefficient!

- In a nutshell:
- testing offers ground to place decisions (e.g. statements in article should always be significant)
- yet do it with care: results depend on sample size and assumptions, evidence ≠ truth
