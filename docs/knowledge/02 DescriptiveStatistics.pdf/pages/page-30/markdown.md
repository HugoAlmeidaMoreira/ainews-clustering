Check the notebook on descriptive statistics to tackle the following challenges:

- describe the **jokes** dataset, including the distribution jokes' length and sentiment-based features
- what is the likelihood of a joke to have negative valence (polarity)?
- are the rating of jokes correlated with length- and sentiment-based features?
- is there a correlation between subjectivity and polarity features?
- does joke length significantly differ for positive, neutral and negative jokes?

- consider funny jokes to have rates above 6 (≥7).
- are hilarity (funny or not) and valence sign (positive, neutral, negative) associated?
- does joke subjectivity discriminate hilarity? And valence sign?
