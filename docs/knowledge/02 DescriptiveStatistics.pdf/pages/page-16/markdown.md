# Preprocessing procedures

- [discretization] numeric variables can be discretized into ordinal variables
- e.g. age categories of 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40...
- trade-off: loss of information versus utility for subsequent data analysis
- [normalization] numeric variables can be normalized
- comparability between variables with different domains E
- [aggregation] categoric variables with high cardinality can be aggregated
- 100 colors can be aggregated into coarser categories in accordance with hue
- [imputation] missing values can occur
- unobserved, error or noisy measurements
- missings can be imputed using variable expectations
