# Apply and evaluate agglomerative clustering using the manhation distance

assinalar as resposta correta
## 
A) all observation are merged at a distance of 2 under the mini / single linkage criterion
B) The distance between x1 and x3 id square root of 5
c) considering a perfect cluster reference alignment, the silhouette of x1 is 0.33
D) x1 and x3 are the first to be merged under the maximum / complete linkage criterion  
E) the purityy of the clustering solution is {{x1},{x2, x3}} is 0.66



a) B=({x2,x3},{y1,y2}) is a constant bicluster with quality of 2/3


b) The confidence of the rule {y1=1,y2=3} ⇒A is 100%


c) Given a minimum support of 2, pattern {y2=3,A} is closed


d) Bicluster B=({x2,x3},{y1,y2}) is a perfect order-preserving


e) The lift of the rule {y1=1}=>A is 2/3


f) The relative support of the pattern {y2=3,A} is 2/3
