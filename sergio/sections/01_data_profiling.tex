% PROJECT STATEMENT — relevant excerpts (see full text in `sections/project_statement_full.tex`)
% "Regarding data profiling and representation:
% - the groups should perform a statistical analysis of the datasets in advance, and summarize relevant implications in the report, such as the underlying distributions, relevant statistics and hypothesized forms feature dependency;"
% 
% "- adequate data representations should be pursued for projects with non-tabular data structures and unstructured variables using domain-guided transformations or representation learning (embeddings);"
% 
% "- the underlying complexity of the datasets can be assessed via summarization capacity using linear methods, such as PCA, and non-linear methods, such as autoencoders;"
% 
% Use: include descriptive statistics, distribution plots, missingness, correlation/feature dependency hypotheses, and representation diagnostics (PCA reconstructions, latent-dim analysis, etc.).

\section{DATA PROFILING}
\label{sec:data_prof}
\subsection{Descriptive statistics}
\subsubsection{Dataset 1}
\dotfillplaceholder
\subsubsection{Dataset 2 - Customer Analysis}
\par The dataset in study is the publicly available Customer Personality Analysis present in the following Kaggle \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis/data}{URL}.
\par A brief analysis is presented below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset has 2240 rows and 28 columns including the class "Response".
    \item 24 numeric variables and 3 symbolic and a binary class variable.
    \item Variable \textbf{Income} contains 24 missing values.
    \item Class distribution is 331 true and 1881 false observations
\end{itemize}
\par Prior to any clustering or outlier analysis the following data preparation steps were followed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Feature selection analysis through low variance. Variables identified for later removal during clustering and outlier analysis
    \item Rows with missing values were dropped
    \item Date column was dropped due to ot being relevant in this process
    \item InterQuartile Range (IQR) and standard Deviation (stdev) outlier analysis identified that all the dataset's variables contain multiple observations that could be identified as outliers
    \item Data was scaled according to the MinMax approach
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Explainable models \normalfont(optional)}
Predictive models applied in the precursor Data Science Eng. course can be optionally visualized/interpreted here. SHAP is suggested to this end.
